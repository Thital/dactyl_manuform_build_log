## Assembly
### Printing
Right side uses [this](https://thangs.com/designer/ZackFreedman/3d-model/Dactyl-ManuForm%205x6%20Mechanical%20Keyboard-10466) stl.

However i realized it doesn't have a nice place to put the microcontroller.

So for the left side i generated it using https://ryanis.cool/dactyl/#manuform

I had to modify the holder because i used a clone pro micro so be mindful of your microcontroller footprint.
